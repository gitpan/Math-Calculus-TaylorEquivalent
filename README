Math::Calculus::TaylorEquivalent version 0.1
============================================

This module provides an expression object with a Taylor Equivalent method,
which decomposes the expression and another expression into the first N
terms of their Taylor series and compares the co-efficients so try and
decide whether the expressions are equivalent. It understands the operators
+, -, *, / and ^ (raising to a power) as well as the functions sin, cos,
tan, sec, cosec, cot, sinh, cosh, tanh, sech, cosech, coth, asin, acos,
atan, asinh, acosh, atanh, ln and exp. Functions are valid either side of
all operators.
